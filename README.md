## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal that supports investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, we were able to create visualizations to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times. Specifically, this set of visualizations:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.




## Results
The analysis and visualizations are displayed below.

In the visualization above we can see where the most common areas of bike sharing trends end. As we can see in the image Manhattan is a common place where the bike sharing trend ends.

This heatmap above provides us a more in-depth breakdown of popular times and the number of trips within a day.

The line chart above displays the checkout times for users which we can use to determine the most common bike-ride duration.

Lastly, this visualzation displays a gender breakdown with checkout time trends and gender trends for the bike-sharing service.













## Summary
After analyzing the visualizations, we can infer that many of these users may not be tourists but rather work commuters, as most of the peak times are around morning and evening commutes. A majority of the users were male riders. Another significant point that can be made is that most of the ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes. If there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, it would help if each station can be set up within 10 minutes of biking distance from each other. This is because we need to take into account that NYC is a large city, where as Des Moines is mainly suburbs. Places tend to be farther apart in suburbs compared to places in large cities.
